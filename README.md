# SVExtraSlotsTool
Adds more cabins to a Stardew Valley vanilla save. Does not require SMPAI or any mods to work.

## Usage
Launch the exe file to start. The Find button will populate the fields with your save file's information. Select the desired save from the drop down and click the add button to add a slot. Currently the tool only adds one cabin at a time with a maximum of 6 cabins. Your save needs to have the first 3 cabins that can be added when creating a new game. Extra cabins with be placed beside existing cabins on the inner side. Extra cabins will be placed on existing objects: rocks, trees, branchs, etc. which need to be removed if possible or the cabin can be moved at Robin's to a clear location.
